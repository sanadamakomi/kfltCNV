Description: CNV (copy number variations) can be detected by read depth data from
   Next-generation Sequencing. Read depth is Gaussian so we can use the Kalman
   Filter to estimate the real level of copy number. The Kalman filter is a
   set of recursive linear estimation steps, which computes an estimation
   value at time 't+1' based on the estimation value at time 't' and the
   observation value at time 't+1'. Its estimates are linear combinations of
   Gaussian data when the noise disturbances are Gaussian.
